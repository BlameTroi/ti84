<P align=center><FONT size=6>Getting the tools to work</FONT></P>
<P>If you haven't realized it yet, assembly is hard.</P>
<P>However, getting everything to work so that you can deal with the confusion 
of assembly is even harder.</P>
<P>Thus, this tutorial... To tell you how to get the tools of assembly to work, 
but I won't tell you how to program in asm. Why am I doing this? Simple, I don't 
want anyone else to have to suffer the month it took me to actually get one asm 
program/app to work. It's a pain.</P>
<P>Hint: If you see a <A title="Much like this" style="COLOR: #000000" 
href="file:///C:/Programming/TI/Assembly/Help%20Files/The%20Start%20of%20Started.html#blackLink">black 
link</A><A name=blackLink></A> on this page, try holding the mouse over it for a 
few seconds, and you'll probably see a useful tip of some sort.
<P>
<P>The first step to getting the world of assembly tools to behave is to get 
your computer ready for them... This is just a bit of housekeeping to keep your 
hard drive cleaner than it otherwise would be... Trust me, this is worth 
doing...</P>
<P>In the root of the <A title="C:\ &nbsp;D:\ &nbsp;ect..."

<P>What's the point of a directory structure that complex? It allows for a lot 
of adjustments in the future (including more assemblers, more debuggers, and the 
inclusion of other programming languages). It keeps things organized very well, 
and that's the first key to success in programming.</P>
<HR>
<!-- Beginning of the Downloads Section -->
<P><FONT size=5>Downloads</FONT></P>
<P>Looking over the directories should give you some idea of what's in sore for 
your little computer, and what you need to use for assembly... You need

<P>Now, I can tell you how and where to download everything that you'll ever 
need for asm program/app creation.</P><BR>

you could possibly download all at once, go <FRAMESET NAME="everything"><A

<P>However, for those of us who follow directions a bit better, start by 
downloading: 
<UL>
  <LI>An <A title="Zilog's Assembler" 
  href="http://www.zilog.com/support/software/zds368.exe">assembler</A>. 
  <BR>This is Zilog's Assembler, ZDS (current version: 3.68). Total download 
  size: ~9 megs. Download the file into the <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Assemblers\Installers</FONT> folder, and install it to the <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Assemblers\ZDS</FONT> folder. <BR>- If you go straight to the <A 
  title="The guys who make the Calc's Processor" href="http://www.zilog.com/" 
  target=Zilog>Zilog Home Page</A> itself, you might find the Zilog Developer's 
  Studio files, but you'll probably find versions that don't work with what you 
  need. If it says anything like: "Note: This version of ZDS is intended for 
  eZ... and e.... customers only.", it is NOT what you want. Furthermore, if it 
  says "Download requires a registration key," again, that's not what you want, 
  because what you do with ZDS does not require registration of the program. 
  (Check the "<A href="http://www.zilog.com/support/oldzds.html" 
  target=Zilog>Previous ZDS Versions</A>" link) <BR><A

  href="http://education.ti.com/" 
  target=education.ti.com>education.ti.com</A></FRAMESET> and searching for "83 
  plus flash debugger". <BR>This is TI's official Flash Debugger. Download size: 
  ~4.2 megs. Download this file to <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Debuggers\Installers</FONT> and install it to <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Debuggers\TI</FONT>. <BR>- It's a little bit tough to get used

  href="ftp://ftp.ti.com/pub/graph-ti/sw-apps/ticonnect/TIConnectV1.3.0.1_ENG.exe">TI 
  Connect</A>. <BR>The program used to send your files to the calc. Download 
  size: ~9 megs. This software is required if you have a USB cable for your 
  calculator. However, if you have the original Graph Link cable (the one that 
  doesn't plug into the USB port), you can still use TI's older, and much 
  smaller (~1.2 megs) version, <A

  href="ftp://ftp.ti.com/pub/graph-ti/sw-apps/link/windows/ti83pusa.exe">TI 
  Graph Link</A>, though TI-Connect is still recommended because of it's 
  versatility. <BR>- It doesn't matter what folder you install TI-Connect or the 
  Graph Link software to, the computer straightens all that out in the end... 
  Though a point to note: after installing either the graph link, or TI-Connect, 
  and you choose to read the readme file, the program may forget to ask you to 
  restart the computer. You MUST do so before the program will work right. (I've 
  uselessly uninstalled it before after determining that it didn't work, because 
  I read the readme file... So RESTART after install!) <BR><A

<P>Congrats! Thanks to the hours you've now spent downloading and installing

<P>The first thing you want to do is to create a template to base the rest of 
your work off of.</P><A name=step1></A>
<OL>To create a template: 
  <LI>Open ZDS. 
  <LI>Go to [File]-&gt;[New Project] 
  <LI>Check that "Family" is selected in the "Selection by" box. If it's not 
  selected, select it. 
  <LI>On the Master list, select Z180. 
  <LI>In the Project Target list, Z80180 should be selected. If it is not, 
  select it. 
  <LI>The Emulator box will probably read "Not Available", but that doesn't 
  matter, that's why you downloaded the flash debugger. 
  <LI>Now, click the &nbsp;<BUTTON>...</BUTTON> at the end of "Project Name" 
  <LI>Go to your <FONT color=#0000ff>Programming\TI\Assembly\Source Code</FONT> 
  folder. 
  <LI>Click the "make a new folder" button, and create a new folder called 
  "Default APP". 
  <LI>Go into your Default APP folder, and type in "Default APP" as the project 
  name, and click OK. 
  <LI>Click the OK button on the new project window. 
  <LI>Click the OK button on the window that pops up complaining about your 
  selected Emulator 
  <LI>Good job! You're into your new project. Now, go to [File]-&gt;[New File], 
  a blank file called "Untitled1" will pop open. 
  <LI>Now, you need to fill that file with something useful. You could start by 
  taking some of the pre-header information out of <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Debuggers\TI\Demo\hello.asm</FONT>, and the rest of the header 
  out of <A

  href="http://education.ti.com/downloads/pdf/us/ti83pseadn.pdf" target=pdfs>The

  necessary). 
  <LI>Now, since the program's different, you'll need a different source file... 
  TI doesn't offer any good templates, so the only one I can give you is my own:

  to set the linker settings...) the file as <FONT color=#0000ff>Default</FONT> 
  in your <FONT color=#0000ff>Source Code\Default Prog</FONT> folder. 
  <LI>Hit Alt+F7 to rebuild it, and... it should work. 
  <P>If it doesn't work... See the <A style="COLOR: #000000"

<P>To prevent destruction/corruption of the two template projects you've just

won't even let you type when they're open, however, you can still copy out the 
contents to a new file.</P>
<HR>

<P><FONT size=5>Prepping for the Calc</FONT></P>
<P>The next step (the next to last step) in getting your apps and progs ready 
for the calculator involves running the Apps through Wappsign, and running the 
progs through convhex. (Generally, you'd debug them with TI's Flash debugger 
before proceeding to this step, but with the completely empty program and app 
you've written so far, you can't do much harm to your calc. - TI's tutorial, 
starting on page 129 of the SDK guide, works well, so I won't say anything...) 
I'll start with the apps.</P>
<OL><FONT size=+1>App's Final Step</FONT> 
  <LI>Open <FONT color=#0000ff>Wappsign.exe</FONT>, located in the <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Debuggers\TI\Utils</FONT> folder. 
  <LI>Turn on the "Auto detect key file", "Sign on drop", and "Save settings on 
  exit" options, turning OFF the "Only run Fillapp" option. 
  <LI>Hit the "Detect key File Now" button. If the output window displays 
  something like: "WAPP1005: Key file cannot be successfully detected", click 
  the triple dot button after the blank Key file field, and select the <FONT 
  color=#0000ff>Debugger\TI\Utils</FONT> directory, and select the key file 
  there: <FONT color=#0000ff><TT>0104.key</TT></FONT>. 
  <LI>Click OK. 
  <LI>When asked to add the directory to your search path, select Yes. 
  <LI>Now, you have two choices. Either open a window in Windows Explorer and 
  drag and drop the file into the Applications field, or hit the triple dot 
  button after the applications field and look for your hex file that way. 
  <LI>Once you've selected your key file and app, if you used the "..." button 
  to find your app, click the sign button, and you're done. If you just dragged 
  and dropped your file, you're already done, it signs the file as soon as you 
  drop it into the Application field. </LI></OL>
<OL><FONT size=+1>Prog's Final Step</FONT> 
  <P>Unfortunately, the final step for programs is a lot longer than the one for 
  apps... You have to run your hex file through a program called ConvHex. </P>
  <LI>Start by downloading <A title="Converts hex files to 8xp's" 
  href="http://education.ti.com/downloads/exe/convhex.exe">ConvHEX</A>, and 
  placing it in the <FONT color=#0000ff>Source Code</FONT> directory. 
  <LI>Now, you need two more files (well, you don't NEED them, they just make 
  things a lot easier), this time, of your own creation. The first is a program 
  to make convhexing easier, and the second makes selecting the file simpler. - 
  If you don't want to store each project in it's own folder, then you can 
  ignore these files and just run convhex.exe with your hex file from the 
  command prompt (assuming they're in the same folder). 
  <P>The first file will be <FONT color=#0000ff>convhex.bat</FONT>, placed in 
  the <FONT color=#0000ff>Source Code</FONT> directory.</P>
  <P>To save these files the way you need to, open Notepad, copy the contents 
  in, and click the Save button. Put quotes around the name while you're saving 
  it, and include the extension of the file name. (ie, type "convhex.bat" - WITH 
  quotes into the text box) Under the name field, change the save type from 
  "Text Documents (*.txt)" to "All files", and click save.</P>

  names. (So you'll have to make a new project to test the files) </LI></OL>
<P>Well, you're done! Now, all that's left is to send the files to your

  <P><FONT color=#ff0000>If it can't find your communication settings, make sure 
  both the calc and link cable are plugged in to each other and the computer,

  trying again. If you go through every com port and it still doesn't work, try 
  restarting your computer and having absolutely no other programs (or at least, 
  as close as you can get to no other programs) open before you try to send.

size=+1><B>(housekeeping for programs)</B></FONT> 
<P>Now that you've got the wonderful program (not app - apps should ignore this 
section) that you wrote on your calculator, you do like any sensible person, and 
try to use it. But all of a sudden, the calc goes haywire, and gives you this 
crazy thing called a "Syntax Error"... What? Didn't you just compile it 
perfectly? Didn't you just send it to the calc without a hitch? Didn't it even 
run in the debugger perfectly?</P>
<P>Yup. But the answer is that it doesn't matter, the calc's stupid. There's one 
last step left to get the calc to run your program nicely... 
<OL><B>Making The Program Run Flawlessly!</B> 
  <LI>Hit the yellow Second button, followed by the 0 button, to bring up the 
  Catalog. 
  <LI>Scroll through the catalog until you reach an entry labeled "AsmComp(" 
  (the first one beyond the screen), and hit enter. 
  <LI>"AsmComp(" pastes itself to the home screen. 
  <LI>Without hitting any other buttons, hit the [PRGM] button to bring up the 
  list of executable programs, and select the program you just sent to yourself. 

  <LI>Now, hit the "," button, and go to [PRGM] again, and select the same 
  program again... Except this time, change the name a bit... Maybe add a 1 on 
  the end, or a Z at the beginning (keep it to a max of 8 letters though... just 
  misspell it a bit). 
  <LI>Hit enter. This compiles your assembly program (again), into a new, 
  improved, and even smaller version, titled whatever you titled the second 
  file. If you want proof, hit "2nd" and "+" to bring up the memory screen, hit 
  2 to bring up the management screen, and 7 to just show the programs. Find 
  both programs, and the new one will be smaller than the first one. 
  <LI>Now, even though you're in the memory management screen and could easily 
  delete the first program, because you don't need it anymore, DON'T! 
  <LI>Instead, go to the program menu again, and hit right to edit the 
  programs... Start editing the first program (the one you originally sent to 
  the calculator), and clear it out... Completely! Just hit [CLEAR] + [DEL] a 
  bunch of times, and you'll be done quite quickly... 
  <LI>Now, you've got a completely empty program to mess with. It has a purpose. 
  Open the catalog again, and select the choice at the bottom of the screen, 
  "Asm(". It'll paste into the program. 
  <LI>Now, while still in the program, hit the [PRGM] button again, and go all 
  the way right to the "EXEC" menu. Select your new program (the one you just 
  compiled), and hit enter, so that it pastes into the program you just cleared 
  out... <BR>It should look like <TT>Asm(prgmWHATEVER</TT> 
  <LI>Now quit, and use the emptied out program just like any other normal 
  program, except for how it runs the newly compiled program without forcing the 
  user to type in <TT>Asm(prgmWHATEVER</TT> before every run! </LI></OL>
